I'm Bakhtawar Ilyas, an undergraduate Cybersecurity student and an AI enthusiast with hands-on experience in incident response, threat detection, and vulnerability assessment.
I enjoy combining AI with cybersecurity to build practical, real-world tools — from log analysis bots to network simulation and secure communication frameworks
Always curious, always learning.

 Core Focus Areas
🛡️ Incident Response & Forensics
Set up and configured secure network environments using pfSense, Suricata, and Wazuh to detect and respond to attacks like Hydra brute force and analyze logs in real time.

 AI for Security
Built systems for AI-based vulnerability prioritization and log analysis chatbots that aid in identifying and mitigating threats from Windows Event Logs.

 Research & ZTNA
Researched Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA) at Protect Lab, working on secure communication tools over TCP/UDP and contributing to the development of the SEC T tool.

Secure Web Scanning
Developed Secure Scan, a web-based SSL/TLS security analyzer that uses SSLScan and TestSSL to evaluate protocol support and certificate vulnerabilities.

 Featured Projects
AI Chatbot for Windows EventLog Analysis – Python NLP chatbot for forensic log investigation.

Incident Detection Lab – Full incident response setup with Wazuh SIEM, Suricata IDS, pfSense DMZ.

AI-Based Vulnerability Prioritization System – AI model to rank OS/network vulnerabilities by severity.

Filmception – ML/NLP tool that classifies multilingual movie summaries by genre.

Secure Scan (Internship Project) – Analyzes SSL/TLS configurations for vulnerabilities using open-source tools.
